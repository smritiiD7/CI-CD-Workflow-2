# GitHub Actions ‚Äî Mini Guide / README

---

## 1. What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions allows you to **automate CI/CD workflows** directly in your GitHub repository using YAML configuration files stored in the `.github/workflows/` folder.

---

## 2. Basic Terminologies & Reserved vs Non-Reserved Keywords

### a) Reserved Keywords (must be used as-is):

| Reserved Keywords   | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`              | Name of the workflow                                           |
| `on`                | Specifies events that trigger the workflow                     |
| `jobs`              | Groups all jobs                                                |
| `runs-on`           | OS runner (like `ubuntu-latest`)                               |
| `steps`             | Defines list of commands to run in a job                       |
| `uses`              | Uses an action from GitHub Marketplace                         |
| `run`               | Direct shell commands                                          |
| `with`              | Passes parameters to an action                                 |
| `needs`             | Creates dependency on other jobs                               |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Manual trigger declaration (for manually running the workflow) |

### b) Non-Reserved (User-Defined) Keywords:

| Non-Reserved                                    | Meaning                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Workflow Name (`name`)                          | Any string (e.g., "Test Project")        |
| Job IDs (`test`, `deploy`)                      | Job names can be anything you choose     |
| Step names (`Get Code`, `Install dependencies`) | Purely for human readability             |
| Version (`@v3`, `@v4`)                          | Action versions, changeable              |
| Input values (`node-version: '18'`)             | Changeable depending on your requirement |

## 3. Example ‚Äî GitHub Actions Workflow Explained

```yaml
name: Test Project   # Non-reserved (Workflow Name)

on: push            # Reserved - Event Triggered when code is pushed

jobs:              # Reserved

  test:            # Non-reserved (Job ID - you can rename it)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest   # Reserved
    steps:        # Reserved
      - name: Get Code      # Non-reserved (Step name)
        uses: actions/checkout@v3    # Reserved
      - name: Install NodeJS
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:             # Reserved
          node-version: '18'    # Non-reserved (Value)

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install   # Reserved (run)

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

---

## 4. workflow\_dispatch ‚Äî Manual Workflow Trigger

If you want to **manually trigger a workflow** from GitHub‚Äôs UI:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:    # Reserved
```

You can also accept **input parameters**:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Choose the environment'
        required: true
        default: 'production'
```

This will show a "Run workflow" button on GitHub where you can select the environment.

---

## 5. Job Dependency using `needs`

To run jobs in **a particular order**:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  deploy:
    needs: test    # Reserved keyword - waits for 'test' job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy step
        run: echo "Deploying after successful test"
```

Here, the `deploy` job will only run after the `test` job finishes successfully.

---

## 6. Checking Repo Files on Runner Machine

To see how your repo is downloaded on the GitHub-hosted machine:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Before Checkout
    run: ls -a

  - name: Checkout Repo
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: After Checkout
    run: ls -a
```

---

## 7. Important Notes:

‚úÖ **Job ID (like `test`, `deploy`)** ‚Äî customizable (user-defined)
‚úÖ **Runner Image (`ubuntu-latest`)** ‚Äî can be changed to `windows-latest`, etc.
‚úÖ **Step Names (`Get Code`, `Install NodeJS`)** ‚Äî purely descriptive, not functional
‚úÖ **Event Triggers (`push`, `pull_request`)** ‚Äî predefined, not customizable
‚úÖ **Actions (`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`)** ‚Äî must use correct names from GitHub Marketplace
‚úÖ **Manual trigger with `workflow_dispatch`** ‚Äî lets you run workflows on demand

---

## 8. Example ‚Äî Manual + Push Trigger Combined

```yaml
on:
  push:           # Trigger on push
  workflow_dispatch:    # Manual trigger as well
```

---

## Summary Table: Reserved vs Non-Reserved

| **Reserved (Cannot Change)**                                                          | **Non-Reserved (Customizable)**                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `on`, `jobs`, `steps`, `uses`, `run`, `with`, `needs`, `runs-on`, `workflow_dispatch` | Job IDs, Workflow name, Step names, Input values, Action versions |

# GitHub Actions Workflow Triggers Explained

This document explains how to manage workflow triggers in **GitHub Actions**, covering events, activity types, filters, pull requests from forks, and workflow skipping/canceling.

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Available Events

GitHub Actions supports various event types that can trigger workflows.

### Common Events:

| Event               | Description                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `push`              | Triggered when commits are pushed to the repository.      |
| `pull_request`      | Triggered on PR activities like open, synchronize, close. |
| `schedule`          | Cron-based scheduled trigger.                             |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Manual run via GitHub UI.                                 |

### Example:

```yaml
on: 
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - develop
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs daily at midnight
```

---

## 2. üè∑Ô∏è Activity Types

You can fine-tune event triggers based on the **specific activity type**.

### Example: Trigger workflow only when a PR is opened or edited:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited]
```

**Common types:**

* `opened`
* `edited`
* `reopened`
* `synchronize`

---

## 3. üéØ Event Filters

Control when workflows run using **branch or file path filters**.

### Example 1: Run workflow **only on the main branch**:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

### Example 2: Run workflow **only when files in `/src/` change**:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
```

---

## 4. üîÄ Pull Requests & Forks

* **Initial approval required** for workflows triggered by PRs from **forked repositories**.
* Prevents malicious workflows from untrusted contributors.

### Example Behavior:

A PR from a fork will **not run the workflow until manually approved** by a repository maintainer.

---

## 5. üö´ Cancelling & Skipping

### ‚ùå Automatic Cancelling:

* If any job **fails**, dependent jobs may be canceled unless configured otherwise.

### ‚úã Manual Cancelling:

* You can **cancel workflows manually** from the **Actions tab** in GitHub.

### ‚è© Skipping Workflows:

You can **skip workflows intentionally** via commit messages:

```
git commit -m "Minor change [skip ci]"
```

GitHub Actions will **not run any workflow** for this commit.

| Feature                   | Explanation                                    | Example / Note                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Event Types**           | Define what triggers workflow (push, PR, etc.) | `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule` |
| **Activity Types**        | Define specific sub-event activities           | `types: [opened, edited]`          |
| **Event Filters**         | Run only for target branches/paths             | `branches: ['main']`               |
| **Pull Requests & Forks** | Manual approval for PRs from forks             | Prevents malicious PRs             |
| **Cancelling & Skipping** | Cancel on failure, skip via commit msg         | `[skip ci]` in commit message      |

## **How to Know the Required Dependencies for CI/CD (When You Aren‚Äôt the Developer)?**

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Look at the Project‚Äôs Dependency Files**

Most application repos clearly define dependencies in a file (or files) used by the build tool or package manager.

You don't need coding knowledge, just the ability to recognize these files.

Here are examples:

| Language / Framework | Dependency File | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Node.js (JavaScript)** | `package.json` | Lists all npm dependencies |
| **Python** | `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` | Lists all Python libs |
| **Java (Maven)** | `pom.xml` | Contains Maven dependencies |
| **Java (Gradle)** | `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` | Dependencies for Gradle |
| **Go** | `go.mod`, `go.sum` | Module and dependency info |
| **.NET** | `.csproj` | Dependencies for .NET |
| **Ruby** | `Gemfile` | Dependencies for Ruby |
| **Rust** | `Cargo.toml` | Rust dependencies |

üìå **Example:**

If it's a Node.js app:

```

Look for package.json

```

If Python:

```

Look for requirements.txt

```

### ‚úÖ 2. **Check Project Documentation (README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md)**

Good developers mention build steps and dependencies in `README.md`.

Example:

```

To run this project:

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python app.py

```

‚û°Ô∏è You can extract this and convert into your CI pipeline easily.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Ask the Development Team**


### ‚úÖ 4. **Check the Existing Build Scripts**

See if there‚Äôs any `Makefile`, `build.sh`, or other scripts in the repo.

They often contain:

```bash
bash
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
mvn clean install

```

Whatever you find here should probably go into your CI pipeline steps.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Run the App Locally (Optional but Powerful)**

Even without development knowledge, you can try:

```bash
bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd project-directory
npm install or pip install -r requirements.txt

```

See if the app starts or builds locally.

If it runs, your pipeline will likely work too.

### ‚úÖ 6. **Common CI-CD Dependency Install Example:**

For a Python App:

```yaml
yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: Set up Python
    uses: actions/setup-python@v4
    with:
      python-version: '3.11'

  - name: Install dependencies
    run: pip install -r requirements.txt

```

For Node.js App:

```yaml
yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: Setup Node
    uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '20'

  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm install

```

## üéØ **Your Golden Rule as a DevOps/CloudOps Engineer:**

‚úÖ **Never assume dependencies ‚Äî always check the repo.**

‚úÖ **Communicate clearly with devs if unsure.**

‚úÖ **Understand basic package managers for popular languages (npm, pip, Maven, etc.).**

‚úÖ **Inspect CI examples of similar projects (open-source repos, GitHub actions,**
